    <p>
    	808080 is the space that we all inhabit, between past and future, fortune and tragedy.
It is an acknowledgment and reclamation of the times that we live in: in which things seem bleak and uncertain, yet there is no choice but to keep going. 
808080 is a location of uncertainty between action and inaction, positivity and negativity, optimism and pessimism. 
808080 is about existing in the light, the dark, and navigating through the gray.
